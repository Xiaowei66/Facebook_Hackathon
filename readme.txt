This project was created for the Sydney Facebook Hackathon 2019.

The project aimed at creating a rank based translation experience for users. Think stack overflow for translation apps.

The backend essentially calls multiple translation API's, or users can store their own translations. 
These translations can then be upvoted and downvoted and ranked.

The react-native app shows a basic display, of what a potential user experience could be.


Edit: We came third place! 😁
